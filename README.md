# Neural Latent State and Dynamics Inference Workshop

Neural recordings are high-dimensional and complex.
 We aim to find spatiotemporal structure in data in order to "understand" it better, but what is the right kind of structure to look for?
In this workshop, we will introduce the statistical problem of inferring latent state trajectories from high-dimensional neural time series and how it is related to dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA).
Subsequently, we will introduce the statistically more difficult, but theoretically more satisfying inference of the latent nonlinear dynamical system.
There will be hands-on components to try some of the methods.

## Code setup:

1. Clone the repo using `git clone --recursive`

1. If you missed the `--recursive` option, your `nlb_tools` folder will be empty. Use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to download the submodules

1. Make a conda environment using the requirements.txt with 
    `conda env create -f env.yml`

1. Activate the conda environment using `conda activate lvmworkshop`

1. Further install 
 `pip install git+https://github.com/catniplab/vjf.git`
 and 
 `pip install git+https://github.com/yuanz271/vlgpax.git`

## Datasets
We will be focusing on two datasets â€“ a toy dataset of spiking data with low dimensional dynamics governed by
a Van der Pol Oscillator and electrophysiological recordings from the motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) 
of a monkey during a delayed reaching task.

### Van der Pol Oscillator

  - To setup this dataset move to the code pack folder using `cd code_pack/` then run `python generate_vdp_data.py`

### Monkey reaching task

  - To setup the dataset install dandi using either `pip install dandi` or `conda install -c conda-forge dandi`
  - Then navigate to the data folder in the repo `cd mc_maze/data/`
  - Download the data using `dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000128`
